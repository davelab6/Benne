Benne, a Kannada + Latin typeface
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Proposal:
The design objective is to design a single regular text weight Kannada font. This is to be paired with EB Garamond 12â€™s Adobe Latin 3 glyph set.

Aims:
The aim is simply to create an improved reading experience for Kannada text faces. Considering how often we read on screen, and how every day tasks are becoming more and more prevalent, there is a lack of acceptable fonts for South Indian scripts. The function of which is to improve readability on screen. 

Context:
The fonts will hopefully be used in digital mediums. Primary usage scenarios would include websites and online in browsers. Other intended environments include deskptop publishing applications and quick editing documents for writing and reading. Academic/commercial documents which use either or both writing systems.
